# Professional React Portfolio - Module 20

## About This Project

#### This Portfolio is meant to show a little bit about me and my skills as a full stack developer. Some of my previous projects are displayed and everything is created using REACT.

## How it works:

#### The portfolio initializes with redering all of my react components on one page. Using the navigation tabs at the top of the page uses anchors to reach each piece of information on my page. You can contact me through a contact form.

## Challenges:

#### I had trouble conditionally rendering pages to create a multi page experience and also loading in other components and styling them to work progressively on other screen sizes
